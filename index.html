        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Josué Dubon! I have had the privilege of playing professional soccer in El Salvador for several years, where I honed my skills on the field and developed a deep understanding of the game. Throughout my career, I played as a winger, contributing to my team’s success both offensively and defensively. My time in El Salvador’s first division taught me the importance of discipline, teamwork, and continuous improvement.</p>
        <p>During my professional career, I played for top clubs, where I had the opportunity to compete at the highest level and train alongside some of the best players in the region. This experience gave me invaluable insights into the game, from tactical understanding to fitness and mental toughness, all of which I bring into my coaching sessions today.</p>
        <p>Now, as a coach, I’m dedicated to helping players of all levels improve their skills and reach their full potential. Whether you're looking to improve your dribbling, passing, shooting, or overall soccer IQ, I’m here to help you succeed!</p>
